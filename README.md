// DESCRIPTION

The design of a four-stage pipelined processor using Verilog with basic instructions like ADD, SUB, and LOAD is an important step in understanding how modern processors achieve efficiency and parallelism. A pipelined processor improves execution speed by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions, similar to an assembly line in manufacturing. Instead of waiting for one instruction to fully complete before starting another, the processor is divided into stages, where each stage handles a part of the instruction execution. In this project, we focus on a simple but effective four-stage pipeline consisting of Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), and Write Back (WB). Each stage works independently, and instructions move forward through the pipeline registers at each clock cycle. This approach ensures that at any given moment, multiple instructions are in different phases of execution, thereby improving throughput and demonstrating the basic principle behind high-performance processors.

The instruction set for this processor is intentionally minimal, focusing on three fundamental operationsâ€”ADD, SUB, and LOAD. The ADD and SUB instructions demonstrate arithmetic operations between registers, showcasing how operands are read from the register file, processed by the ALU, and stored back into destination registers. The LOAD instruction highlights the memory interface, where data is fetched from memory and stored into registers. This instruction demonstrates how address calculation and data transfer from memory fit into the pipeline. Even though these three instructions are simple, they represent the foundation upon which more complex instruction sets are built. By implementing only a subset of operations, we are able to concentrate on the pipeline structure, data flow, and the synchronization between stages.

The design includes a set of general-purpose registers, instruction memory, and data memory. The instruction memory holds a predefined program, while the data memory contains the values to be loaded during execution. For every clock cycle, the Instruction Fetch stage reads the instruction from memory based on the program counter (PC). The Instruction Decode stage then interprets the opcode and extracts source and destination registers or immediate values. The Execute stage performs arithmetic or memory address calculations. Finally, the Write Back stage stores the results of the operation back into the register file. To facilitate proper operation, pipeline registers are placed between each stage to hold intermediate values and control signals, ensuring smooth progression of instructions through the pipeline.

One of the main learning aspects of this task is handling hazards. In real processors, hazards occur when instructions overlap in such a way that they depend on the results of one another. In our simplified design, the complexity of hazard detection and forwarding has been minimized, making the pipeline easy to understand for educational purposes. Still, the design introduces the idea of stalls and bubbles, giving a glimpse into how real-world CPUs resolve these challenges. Moreover, the project demonstrates how the clock and reset signals synchronize all the components, showing the importance of timing in digital design.

The Verilog testbench developed alongside the processor is equally important. It initializes instruction and data memory with sample values and runs a short program that executes LOAD, ADD, and SUB instructions. The results are displayed at the end of the simulation to verify correctness. For example, loading values into registers, adding them, and subtracting them provides proof that the pipeline is functioning as expected. This testing method reflects a practical engineering approach, where every design is verified with simulated inputs and outputs before implementation in hardware. The project therefore not only builds theoretical understanding but also provides hands-on skills in coding, debugging, and simulating digital circuits.

In conclusion, this task gives a comprehensive introduction to the concept of pipelined processor design and implementation using Verilog. It captures essential aspects such as instruction execution, memory access, register file usage, and pipeline synchronization. By simplifying the instruction set and focusing on ADD, SUB, and LOAD, it allows learners to concentrate on pipeline behavior without being overwhelmed by complexity. The project outcome is a functional four-stage pipelined processor that demonstrates both the elegance and challenges of CPU design. This serves as a foundational experience for students and interns, preparing them for advanced topics such as hazard handling, forwarding, branch prediction, and the development of more sophisticated instruction sets.
